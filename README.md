## Web Graphics

There are four ways to draw graphics on the web page: 
* Canvas
* SVG
* CSS
* JS DOM animation

Canvas is lower level than SVG, CSS or JS DOM. So we can have more control over the drawing and use less memory, but the cons is, we need to write more code. With the help of JavaScript we can draw various shapes in HTML5 Canvas. The Foundational web graphics have two modes
* Canvas or 2D API 
* 3D or WebGL

While WebGL is powerful, it is also complex and low-level, requiring a lot of boilerplate code to set up scenes, cameras, and renderers. **Three.js** abstracts these complexities, making it easier to create 3D graphics and animations.
